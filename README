Deepslater's Dishonored randomizer is a program you can use to make your next Dishonored run more interesting.

It generates a character for the game you select (if multiple), then generates powers and weapons.

Finally, it generates what I call "mutators," something intended to change your run.
This can be things like Ghost or Clean Hands, or changes to bonecharms, or seeing what the Heart has to say.

Credit for the idea goes to dark0neisvirgin.
I created this program via Chinese wall technique, since there is no source code available.
I wanted to add functionality for other games.
